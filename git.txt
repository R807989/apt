git status: Displays the current status of the repository, including any changes that have not been committed.

git log: Displays a history of commits in the repository, including the commit message, author, and timestamp.
git branch: Displays a list of branches in the repository, including the current branch.


git checkout [branch]: Switches to the specified branch.
